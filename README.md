# Project-Euler

This is a repository containing the solutions for the [Project Euler Questions](https://projecteuler.net/archives). Though I have not yet solved all the questions but I would like to solve them at my pace. You are most welcome to review my solutions and suggest me better and more optimised ways of solving them. As I keep solving the questions, I would add them in the list below and you can refer to their solutions by their numbers on the actual website and also in the list.
